The name you probably will come across first in most places for me is Jason (my first name), however I prefer my middle name, Patrick, exclusively.
I grew up in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where I attended Coastal Carolina University throughout high school as part of the Scholars Academy program.
For my undergrad, I graduated from Clemson University in 2018 with my B.S. in Computer Science.
